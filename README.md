# Adversarial-Task

Generative Adversarial Networks test from Coursera's Advanced Machine Learning - Intro to Deep Learning course. Executed on Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/ .

P.S.
The text was written by someone from the course (not a native English speaker, I strongly suspect), so you will find writing errors like "noize" or references to objects using "him" instead of "it" etc. I haven't corrected them because they are funny as they are.
